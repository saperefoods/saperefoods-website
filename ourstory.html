    <h1>The Origin of Sapere Foods</h1>
    <h3 class="opening-story">
        Ever since he was a kid, Josh Bailey, the founder of Sapere Foods, always took special 
        interest in nutrition and diet. In fact when he 
        was still very young, his parents started to realize 
        that his hearing was starting to get worse, so they took 
        him to a doctor to get it checked. Josh recalls, <p></p>
        “... they would call my name multiple times, and 
        then later ask why I wasn’t responding before. I just 
        couldn’t hear them. I didn’t realize how big of 
        a deal it was at the time.” <p></p>
        His parents were informed that Josh would need to 
        get hearing aids. There was nothing else that 
        they could do.
        <p></p>
        But deciding to hold off on getting the hearing aids right 
        away, Josh’s parents consulted with his grandfather, 
        another medical doctor, who recommended a change in diet: 
        milk-free, with vitamin E supplementation. 
        Soon after following this more holistic approach, 
        Josh’s hearing miraculously returned back to normal, 
        no hearing aids required.
        <p></p>
        Recounting this experience years later, Josh realized that 
        there were lots of other people in the world who suffered 
        from their own health problems, many of which issues 
        lay in the basis of poor nutrition. Why not work 
        to help people all over the world find relief from issues 
        that simple diet changes could correct?

        <section class="title-founder-message">Message from the Founder:</section>
        <section class="body-founder-message">
            I really think that most of the issues people 
            are having around the world, whether it has to 
            do with their physical, mental, or emotional 
            health, are due to problems with diet. I can say 
            from personal experience I feel better when I eat 
            better. I want more people to take control of 
            what they put in their bodies, and feel better 
            as a result. That’s why I founded Sapere Foods. 
            “Sapere” is italian and Latin for “to know” and 
            “to taste”. I want people to know what they are 
            eating, and also enjoy the taste. It might sound 
            crazy, but it’s possible. This movement is about a 
            nation-wide and hopefully one day, a world-wide 
            effort to help people address the basics of their 
            health, and simply put, get their health back with 
            foods that they know are beneficial for their 
            health. I want to move away from food products 
            with artificial ingredients that you can’t 
            understand. And by moving away from, I mean, 
            dropping them completely.
