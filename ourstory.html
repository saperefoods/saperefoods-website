    <h1 class="title-the-origin-of-sapere-foods">The Origin of 
        Sapere Foods: <i>"miraculous intervention"</i></h1>
    <p class="opening-story">
        Ever since he was a kid, Josh Bailey, the founder of Sapere Foods, always took special 
        interest in nutrition and diet. The start of this journey was 
        when he was still very young. His parents started to realize 
        that his hearing was starting to get worse, so they took 
        him to a doctor to get it checked. Josh recalls, <br>
        <i><blockquote class="relating-before">
        “... they would call my name multiple times, and 
        then later ask why I wasn’t responding before. I just 
        couldn’t hear them. I didn’t realize how big of 
        a deal it was at the time.”</blockquote></i>
        His parents were informed that Josh would need to 
        get hearing aids. There was nothing else that 
        they could do.
        <br>
        But deciding to hold off on getting the hearing aids right 
        away, Josh’s parents consulted with his grandfather, 
        another medical doctor, who recommended a change in diet: 
        milk-free, with vitamin E supplementation. 
        Soon after following this more holistic approach, really a 
        miraculous intervention, Josh’s hearing, unbelievably,
        returned back to normal, no hearing aids required.
        <br>
        Recounting this experience years later, Josh realized that 
        there were lots of other people in the world who suffered 
        from their own health problems, many of which issues 
        lay in the basis of poor nutrition. Why not work 
        to help people all over the world find relief from issues 
        that simple diet changes could correct?

            <div type="quote" class="body-founder-message">I really think that most of the issues people 
                are having around the world, whether it has to 
                do with their physical, mental, or emotional 
                health, are due to problems with diet. I can say 
                from personal experience I feel better when I eat 
                better. I want more people to take control of 
                what they put in their bodies, and feel better 
                as a result. That’s why I founded Sapere Foods.

                This movement is about a 
                nation-wide and hopefully one day, a world-wide 
                effort to help people address the basics of their 
                health, and simply put, get their health back with 
                foods that they know are beneficial for their 
                health. I want to move away from food products 
                with artificial ingredients that you can’t 
                understand. And by moving away from, I mean, 
                dropping them completely.” (<a href="">Enter Website/source</a>),
