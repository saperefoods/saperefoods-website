        Sapere Foods: <i>"miraculous intervention"</i></h1><br>
    <p class="opening-story">
        Ever since he was a kid, Josh Bailey, the founder of Sapere Foods, always took special 
        interest in nutrition and diet. The start of this journey was 
        when he was still very young. His parents started to realize 
        that his hearing was starting to get worse, so they took 
        him to a doctor to get it checked. Josh recalls, <br><br>
        <i><blockquote class="relating-before">
        “... they would call my name multiple times, and 
        then later ask why I wasn’t responding before. I just 
        couldn’t hear them. I didn’t realize how big of 
        a deal it was at the time.”</blockquote></i><br>
        His parents were informed that Josh would need to 
        get hearing aids. There was nothing else that 
        they could do.
        <br>
        But deciding to hold off on getting the hearing aids right 
        away, Josh’s parents consulted with his grandfather, 
        another medical doctor, who recommended a change in diet: 
        milk-free, with vitamin E supplementation. 
        Soon after following this more holistic approach, really a 
        miraculous intervention, Josh’s hearing, unbelievably,
        returned back to normal, no hearing aids required.
        <br>
        <br>
        Recounting this experience years later, Josh realized that 
        there were lots of other people in the world who suffered 
        from their own health problems, many of which issues 
        lay in the basis of poor nutrition. Why not work 
        to help people all over the world find relief from issues 
        that simple diet changes could correct?
        <br><br>
        So, he started by adjusting his own diet, slowly. At first it
        wasn't easy to abstain from all the different processed foods 
        he was used to eating, but he kept at it because he would see the 
        short-term benefits of the change almost immediately. A clearer mind and clearer 
        skin were just two of the most immediate benefits. One of the important
        to him though, was the freedom he wanted to have from addictive
        foods. The biggest food companies were targeting people like him and he 
        didn't want anything to do with it.

        Eventually he got to the point where he could control
        his natural cravings for processed foods and decided to start
        working to influence other people in such a way that they
        could make the change too. And that's where "Sapere Foods" came to be.

                really think that a large majority of the issues people 
                are having around the world, whether it has to 
                do with their physical, mental, or emotional 
                health, are due to problems with diet. I can say 
                from personal experience that when I eat 
                better, I feel better, more alive and less lethargic. 
                I want more people to take control of 
                what they put in their bodies, and feel better 
                as a result. That’s why I founded Sapere Foods. 
                <br><br>
                This movement is about a 
                nation-wide and hopefully one day, a world-wide 
                effort to help people address the basics of their 
                health, and simply put, get their health back with 
                foods that they know are beneficial for their 
                health. I want to move away from food products 
                with artificial ingredients that you can’t 
                understand. And by moving away from, I mean, 
                dropping them completely.”</i>
