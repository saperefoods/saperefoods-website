                Welcome! We are so grateful to have you here! As you may know,
                the health of America has been on a downward decline since the late 20th century.
                This is largely due to the changes that have been set in place by large food
                companies. Natural foods have been altered and formed into other "foods" that are more
                addictive, and simultaneously harder for people to moderate consumption of.
                <br>
                <br>
                But there's some good news!
                Sapere Foods aims to inform people not only of the dangers that result from unfettered
                manducation of ultra-processed foods, but the plethora of benefits
                stemming from a diet of natural whole foods.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instead of just letting the world continue to drown in chronic
                illness and disease, due to poor diet choices, we want to build a
                community of people that instead see a future and state of the world that has
                greater, cheaper, and more convenient access to healthy and pure foods. YOU can
                make a difference in the world simply by setting an example, and taking 
                steps to live a healthier life.
                <br>

                Sapere Foods aims to show the world that delicious and healthy food is not and
                should not be out of reach. And you can also be a part of this by supporting in any
                way you can think of; whether that's working with your friends
                to improve your diet, encourage a friend that's trying to get
                healthier, or even following and supporting our movement on our social
                media pages. The more of these things you do, the greater the positive change 
                in the world!
